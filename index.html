<div id="description"><p>This is Jeff Bezos, founder, former CEO, and current Executive Chairman of Amazon, an e-commerce company.</p>
    <p> Jeff was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico on January 12, 1964. 
        As a boy, he was very gifted with intelligence. As expected, he was valedictorian of his high school. 
        After high school, he went on to Princeton University and earn a BSE in electrical engineering.</p>
    <p>Immediately after college, Jeff was offered jobs from well respected places such as Bell Labs, Intel, and Anderson Consulting. 
        But his first job out of college was at fitel, a fintech telecommunications startup. 
        While going through jobs here and there, BEzos read about the internet and how it was growing at a rate of 2300% per year. 
        Therefore, he decided to start an online bookstore. This later expanded and was named Amazon, after the famous river in South America.</p></div>
    <p>Of course, with wealth comes power and this causes people to think they are above others. 
        Jeff has been known not to care for his workers. 
        Many employees have come out complain about the poor work environment. 
        There have been numerous injuries over the years. 
        Also, the employees are subject to extremely harsh time schedules. 
        Many have urinated in bottles to stay on track and keep working.</p>
